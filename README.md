## Custom Laravel Scaffold

Hey there, fellow developers! This is my custom Laravel scaffold used for my personal projects.

### What's under the Hood?

This fantastic scaffold comes packed with powerful tools and goodies that'll make your development experience a breeze:

- [Bref](https://bref.sh) for effortless deployments to AWS Lambda
    - Seamless integration of [Bref's Laravel Bridge](https://bref.sh/docs/frameworks/laravel.html) with exciting
      features:
        - DynamoDB as the `cache` driver
        - S3 serving as the `filesystem` driver, complete with public and private storage options
        - Supercharged queues with SQS as the `queue` driver
    - With a plus of a deploy-ready `serverless.yml` configuration file
- [Laravel Modules](https://github.com/nWidart/laravel-modules) with customized `stubs` for modular awesomeness
- [Laravel DebugBar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar) to turbocharge your development workflow
- [Pest](https://pestphp.com/) for rock-solid unit testing, complete with an updated `phpunit.xml` configuration file
  that covers your modules too
    - [Pest Laravel Plugin](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins#laravel)
    - [Laravel DOM Assertions](https://github.com/sinnbeck/laravel-dom-assertions)
    - With added custom assertions: `toHaveDateFormat()`, `toBeSameDay()`, `toHaveUnitTests()`
- [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy) Your magic wand for effortlessly accessing Laravel routes in
  TypeScript/JavaScript
- [Font Awesome v6](https://fontawesome.com) Because everything looks better with icons
- [Bootstrap v5](https://getbootstrap.com)
- Updated [Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/vite) configuration file to seamlessly build module assets

**But wait, there's more! This scaffold just got even mightier with these awesome additions**:

- **Updated GitHub Workflows for Smart Deployment Actions for every environment:**
    - Dev Environment:
        - Any push to the `develop` branch triggers the deployment job
        - Any merged PR to the `develop` branch triggers the deployment job
        - Both cases execute the CI `tests` job before deployment

    - Staging Environment:
        - Pushing to a `release/*` branch triggers the deployment job
        - CI `tests` job executes before the deployment

    - Production Environment:
        - Only successfully merged PRs to the `main` branch trigger the deployment job
        - CI `tests` job executes prior to deployment

- **Credentials and configuration values are managed through GitHub's secrets/variables:**
    - **Secrets** that must be set:
      - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` Your AWS credentials
      - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` Your AWS credentials
      - `SLS_CERTIFICATE_ARN` ARN of the certificated used for deployments _(must match all environment domains, see below)_.
    - **Variables**:
      - `APP_NAME` to customize deployed app's name _(default: 'Laravel')_
      - `BREF_PHP_VERSION` to specify which PHP version of Bref is used
      - `SLS_BASE_DOMAIN` to set the deployment domain
        - `dev` and `staging` deployments have environment prepend to the domain: ex: dev.example.com
        - `production` deployment with use specified domain without any change
      - `SLS_SERVICE` to customize the deployed service name _(default: 'app')_

Your journey to exceptional Laravel development starts here. Get ready to create, innovate, and make your projects shine
brighter than ever before.
